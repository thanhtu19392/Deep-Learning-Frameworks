# Deep-Learning-Frameworks #

### Why using deep learning frameworks?    ###

- Scales machine learning code
- Computes gradients!
- Standardizes machine learning applications for sharing
- Zoo of Deep Learning frameworks available with different advantages, paradigms, levels of abstraction, programming languages...
- Interface with GPU for parallel processing
